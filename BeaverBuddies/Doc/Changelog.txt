v1.5.0

* NEW (beta): Steam networking support with crossplay! Invite friends via Steam and (once they've loaded the BeaverBuddies mod), they can join. Still a work in progress: feedback appreciated in our Discord thread (see description for how to join)!
* NEW: If Steam peer-to-peer networking is supported for your network, you no longer need to port forward (though direct connection is faster).
* NEW: In-game settings management. No more ReplayConfig.js - you can now edit game settings from within Timberborn. The mod now *requires* the ModSettings mod.

* A number of desync and bug fixes:
  * Crash on Rehost should be fixed
  * Placing conflicting structures (e.g. accidental double-clicking when building) should no longer cause a desync
  * The following buildings should now be supported for network: Wonders, Badwater Dome, District Center (default worker behavior), character/building renaming
* Decreased network load
