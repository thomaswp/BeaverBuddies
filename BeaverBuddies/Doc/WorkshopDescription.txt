Features
[list]
[*] Players work together to build a Beaver civilization.
[*] Players work on the same map in real-time, but each player has their own camera and user interface.
[*] The multiplayer works similar to co-op games like Stardew Valley, Factorio, Dungeons 3, and Parkitect.
[*] All resources and abilities are shared among players, but players who want more independence can use a multi-start map (below). 
[*] Each player can start with their own district! Download a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3372147096]multiplayer map[/url] or create your own in the map editor.
