- Log Data: Information automatically collected during your gameplay session, such as game events and user interactions.

We strive to maintain your privacy by keeping this data largely anonymous. However, because the data is collected as-is, it may inadvertently include details that could identify you (such as file paths or usernames). The developers will not attempt to identify you using this information.

Your Choices:
- If you agree, this data will be sent securely to the developers and used to improve the mod.
- If you do not agree, no data will be sent, and your gameplay will continue without any changes.

By proceeding, you confirm that you are at least the legal age of digital consent in your country of residence.
