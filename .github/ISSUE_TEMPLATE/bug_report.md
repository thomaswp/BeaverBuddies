**Important**: Do not restart Timberborn after your bug has happened. This will overwrite your log file, which is important for diagnosing bugs! You can close the game, but do not restart it until you have submitted this report.

**Describe the bug**
* What happened: [Desync / Crash / Unexpected behavior]
* What were your doing right before this happened?: [Were your doing anything you had not previously done (e.g. created a specific type of building, did something in the user interface?]

**Save File**: On the Server, [find the save file](https://timberborn.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Save_File#Location) for the game the desynced or crashed. Rename the file from `xxx.timber` to `xxx.zip` and upload it here (e.g., by drag-and-drop).
* This is important. It's almost impossible to reproduce errors without the save.

[Optional] **Logs**: On both the server and client computer, do the following steps:
1. Go to the Timberborn local files folder (inside your Timberborn folder), e.g. `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\Mechanistry\Timberborn`
2. Rename the Player.log file to server.txt (for server) and client.txt (for client).
3. Upload these files to this issue.

**To Reproduce**: If you have been able to reproduce this bug multiple times, describe the steps (or delete this section)
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Screenshots**
If this is an unexpected behavior, or there is something unique about your map that caused the bug, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Desktop (please complete the following information for **both** Host and Client):**
 - OS: [e.g. iOS, Windows 11, Ubuntu Linux]
 - Timberborn version: [visible from main menu in the bottom-left corner]
 - BeaverBuddies version: [when you downloaded it, it had a version]
